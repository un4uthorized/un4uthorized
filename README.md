Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Miguel -- Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://ciandt.com/" target="__blank">CI&T</a> working with web development and in my free time I dedicate myself to open source code sustainability. I have a degree in Computer Science from the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais with an emphasis on Software Architecture.

I'm working on extending my backend arsenal by learning about the entire Go language ecosystem. Eventually, I write articles when I feel like I've learned something really great.
