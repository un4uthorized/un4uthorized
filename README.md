<p>Hi there! 👋</p>

<p>
I'm Miguel --- Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://ciandt.com/" target="__blank">CI&T</a> working with web development and in my free time I dedicate myself to open source code sustainability. I have a degree in Computer Science from the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais 🇧🇷 with an emphasis on Software Architecture.</p>

<p>
I'm working on extending my backend arsenal by learning about the entire Go language ecosystem. Eventually, I write articles when I feel like I've learned something really great.
</p>

<p>Reach me</p>
